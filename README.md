# 🎄 Advent of Code 2021 - C# 🎄

Hello there, and welcome to my solutions for Advent of Code 2021. Trying to write functional C# code to solve the tasks and save Santa (or whatever the story is this year!).

Enjoy, be safe, be healthy!

## How to run?
Start the console application and it will ask you for a day, like 1.1 for day 1 and task 1 or 14.2 for day 14 and task 2. 
The console prompt my result for that day. 
So change to your input or testdata in the corresponding file: "inputs/day{daynumber}.txt".
